                        <p>We do agree that this release should mark the end of the 1.x series.
                            Going forward, we’ll switch to Qt 5 and use the chance to boot the
                            all-new 2.0. For such a closing release, it just makes sense to pick
                            something related to the first code name ever given (exercise for the
                            reader), hence why 1.9 is called “Sakura”.</p>

                    <p>The <strong>Blue Winter Rose</strong> is a flower that grows in the glass gardens of Winterfell.
                        It’s pale blue the color of frost. Also, it’s connected to the legend of <strong>Bael the Bard</strong>.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Bael the Bard climbed the Wall.
                            Took the Kingsroad and entered Winterfell.
                            He made himself known as Sygerrik of Skagos, a singer.
                            He sang until midnight for the Lord’s pleasure.
                            Impressed by his skills, Lord Brandon Stark asked him what rewarded he wanted.
                            Bael asked for the most beautiful flower in Winterfell’s gardens.
                            Blue winter roses were just blooming.
                            Brandon Stark agreed to offer him one.</p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>The following morning, the virgin daughter of the lord had disappeared. In her bed was a Blue Winter Rose.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>“Blazing Star” is a mesmerizing and beautiful flower, it is often used
                            as a symbol representing happiness and satisfaction. Tending these
                            flowers requires some patience, the reward is however worth all the hassle.</p>

                        <p>Its beautiful appearance makes it popular among gardeners, don’t be
                            surprised if you are stunned by the florets for hours and hours.
                            Blazing star is also known to have mild medicinal characteristics.
                            A fabulous combination of outer beauty and inner beauty I would say.</p>

                        <p>These days, with almost every web-related test framework gets
                            connected to PhantomJS in one way or another, presenting these
                            attractive yet romantic blossoms marking a joyful relationship could
                            not be a better honor for us.</p>

                        <p>…for this summer  release, I pick the code name “Lavender”. This summer flower is not
                            only beautiful, it is also known for its wonderful scent and soothing
                            quality, often served as a remedy for anything from sore joints to
                            insomnia. Well, with the widespread use of PhantomJS in various
                            testing frameworks since some releases ago, isn’t that exactly what
                            this headless WebKit also brings to many web developers? Helping
                            people to stay calm, avoid anxiety, and increase their productivity is
                            surely a decent goal to have!</p>

                            its native home. In addition, I’m sure you’ll notice the significance

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Approaching the final month before its very first birthday, I’m sure
                            we’re all very happy to see that PhantomJS gains a lot of tractions
                            these days. There are reports of people using it with various
                            JavaScript test frameworks, along with assorted types of continuous
                            integration systems. The ecosystem grows and lately there seems to be
                            an increasing amount of projects using PhantomJS as a basis to do
                            something which was not possible before. In short, it spreads like
                            wild fire. Thus, it just makes sense for me to cast the winter release
                            of PhantomJS, i.e. version 1.4, as “Glory of the Snow”. It’s a winter
                            flower with beautiful colorful star petals which easily grows and
                            spreads to almost everywhere.</p>

                        <p>When I started PhantomJS, I never thought it would be this
                            fascinating. Getting some interests from the integration testing folks
                            is awesome. In particular, I hope (we’re getting there) PhantomJS can
                            be a nice solution for, among others, Ruby developers. Related to
                            this, hereby I designate the autumn release of PhantomJS, i.e. version 1.3,
                            as “Water Lily”, an autumn flower considered by many to be the “jewels of the pond”.</p>

                            many front-end developers. One particular striking example is Twitter.
                            Now, if I allow to pick a random bird (remember the tweet connection),
                            that’ll be sunbird. In particular because Strelitzia nicolai is
                            pollinated by the sunbirds.
                            Strelitzia nicolai is just one species under the genus Strelitzia,

                        <p>I would like to have “seasonal” PhantomJS release schedules. Thus,
                            this month seems to qualify very well for a Spring release of
                            PhantomJS 1.1. Most likely code name for this release is “Cherry
                            Blossom” since there are apparently lots of PhantomJS fans in Japan
                            (search for PhantomJS in Twitter) and with the recent difficult time
                            they have, paying homage to them is the least we can do.”</p>
